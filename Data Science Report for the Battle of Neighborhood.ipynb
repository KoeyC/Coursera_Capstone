If your restaurant is in the wrong place, you won't attract the amount of customers you will need in order to stay in business. The same is true if your location is inundated with competitors, or has poor visibility, or is hard to find. There are many things that must be considered as you look for a location in which to open your business. Thus, it is vital to know what your target market is in order to find the right location for your restaurant."
